      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Created five wireframes for my site. The concept for my personal site is a simple clean flat design. The site concept does not lay much emphasis on headers and footers except for the navigation page which has a footer. The navigation concept is based on the use of hamburger menus on all the pages which link to the navigation page when clicked, the use of the hamburger menu aligns with the site concept of being clean, simple and enables proper use of space. I created five wireframes, One for each page. </p>
