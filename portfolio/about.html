      Greetings! I am <b>Adetokunbo Olutola Osibo</b>,  the mind behind "Pelican Prince". With a background rooted in deploying robust IT infrastructures, including computer network setups, CCTV systems, WiFi networks, and domain controllers, I bring a wealth of practical experience to the world of computer programming. <br>
 
<b>My Journey</b>
 
My journey into the world of coding began as I observed programmers utilizing the networks I deployed as a testing ground for their programs. This exposure sparked a newfound passion, leading me to embark on a career change. I eagerly enrolled in the Computer Programming program at BYU-I, where I honed my skills in Python, HTML, and CSS. Today, I am on a continuous quest to expand my proficiency, currently delving into JavaScript and exploring the Django framework.<br>
 
<b>Vision and Aspirations</b>
 
My aspirations extend beyond the realm of programming. I envision leveraging my coding prowess to tackle real-world challenges across diverse industries. I am driven not only by problem-solving but also by the potential for substantial success in every endeavor. "Pelican Prince" is the manifestation of this vision, a platform where expertise meets creativity to deliver exceptional digital solutions.
